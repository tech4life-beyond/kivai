# KIVAI Platform Charter

**Platform Name:** Kivai  
**Acronym:** K.I.V.A.I. — Knowledge Interface Voice for Artificial Intelligence  
**Organization:** Tech4Life & Beyond LLC  
**Status:** Platform Foundation (In Development)  
**License:** Tech4Life Open Impact License (TOIL) v1.0  

---

## 1. Purpose

Kivai defines an open, standardized execution contract that enables any AI system to safely and consistently control physical devices.

Kivai is not an AI assistant.  
Kivai is the interoperability and execution layer between AI systems and device ecosystems.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

AI can understand natural language, but device ecosystems remain fragmented:

- Each brand uses different APIs and command formats
- Context handoff between devices is inconsistent
- Execution behavior is not deterministic across vendors
- Safety and authorization layers are not standardized
- Users are locked into closed ecosystems

Kivai solves this by defining a universal intent contract and a device-facing API standard.

---

## 3. What Kivai Is

Kivai is:

- A standardized **intent schema** (structured commands)
- A device-facing **Intent API** for execution
- A framework for **context-sharing** and routing
- A foundation for **trust and authorization** layers
- A reference implementation toolkit (SDK + tests + mock devices)

---

## 4. What Kivai Is NOT

Kivai is not:

- A competitor to ChatGPT, Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant
- A closed ecosystem or vendor product
- A replacement for AI/NLP systems
- A “new language” that humans must learn

AI interprets human language.  
Kivai standardizes machine execution.

---

## 5. Core Use Cases

### 5.1 Multi-brand device control
Any AI assistant can generate a Kivai intent payload.  
Any compatible device can execute the payload safely and consistently.

### 5.2 Device interoperability and handoff
Devices can route intents to the best actor (closest device, correct zone, correct capability).

### 5.3 Safety and authorization
Kivai enables deterministic execution rules and standardized permission checks.

### 5.4 Tech4Life product integration
All Tech4Life physical products that contain electronics/software can adopt Kivai as a shared execution standard.

---

## 6. Platform Role Inside Tech4Life

Kivai is designated as a **Platform Layer** of Tech4Life & Beyond LLC.

It supports:

- Product development and interoperability
- Future Tech4Life devices and IoT products
- Licensing and ecosystem expansion under TOIL
- Standardized execution infrastructure across product lines

---

## 7. Success Criteria (v1.0)

Kivai will be considered successful when it delivers:

1. A stable v1.0 intent schema
2. A stable v1.0 Intent API definition
3. A working reference implementation (SDK + validator)
4. A reproducible demo using mock devices
5. Security and trust guidelines baseline
6. Clear integration guidance for third parties

---

## 8. Roadmap Policy

Kivai evolves through versioned schemas and APIs.

- v0.x: experimental and iterative
- v1.0: stable contract and reference tooling
- v1.x: additive improvements without breaking changes
- v2.0: breaking changes only when required

---

## 9. Commercialization and Licensing

Kivai is governed by the Tech4Life Open Impact License (TOIL) v1.0.

Commercial exploitation requires a signed TOIL Royalty Agreement with Tech4Life & Beyond LLC.
