# Legacy Schemas

This folder contains legacy schema drafts kept for historical reference.

## Notes

- `kivai-command.schema.json` is the pre-v1 draft (command/object/trigger).
- The official v1 standard is: `schema/kivai-intent-v1.schema.json`
- A compatibility copy may exist under `kivai_sdk/schema/` until the SDK and tests are migrated.

Do not build new integrations against legacy schemas.
